Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing multiple users to collaborate effectively. It enables users to manage different versions of documents or code, revert to previous states, and maintain a history of modifications. This is essential for software development, as it helps prevent conflicts, supports branching and merging, and ensures accountability. Popular version control systems include Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.
